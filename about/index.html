<meta name="description" content="I&rsquo;m Ramtin Babaei, one of the co-founders of Bavest and currently serving as CEO.
I’m passionate about coding, running, lifting, reading, writing, for sure traveling and also drawing. I’m interested in different topics from AI, capital markets, math to philosophy. My Tsundoku (積ん読) / Antilibrary is growing faster than I read books :)
I care deeply about building things that enhance the current state of tech &amp; life. When my co-founders and I launched Bavest, we were — and remain — driven by the goal of creating creating software and systems that handle extremely large datasets and applying own AI models, which create unique insights, while at the same time rethinking “classical” financial data infrastructure." />
